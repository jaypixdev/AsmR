# AsmR
AsmR is a remastered version of the assembly language designed for modern hardware and optimized for performance. Its syntax has been simplified and made more intuitive to make it easier for developers to write and read code. AsmR supports multiple platforms and comes with an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. AsmR is an open-source project, meaning that anyone can contribute to its development and join its vibrant community of developers. With AsmR, developers can write low-level code for performance-critical applications with ease and confidence.

I will work on this later. Just created the repo in order to remember it
